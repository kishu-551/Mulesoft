MuleSoft Integration with GitHub

1. Introduction to Mulesoft and GitHub Integration
Mulesoft, a leading integration platform, allows businesses to connect applications, data, and devices with APIs. GitHub is a version control platform that helps developers collaborate and manage code repositories. Integrating these two tools enhances project collaboration, version control, and deployment processes.

2. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

A GitHub account
Mulesoft Anypoint Platform account
Anypoint Studio installed on your machine
Basic understanding of Mule projects and Git version control
3. Setting Up GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub Repository:
Log in to your GitHub account.
Click the + button in the top right corner and select New Repository.
Enter a repository name, and description (optional), and choose the visibility (public or private).
Click Create Repository.
4. How to Create a Personal Access Token in GitHub
A personal access token (PAT) in GitHub is a secure way to access the GitHub API, allowing you to authenticate and interact with your repositories and other resources programmatically. This guide will show you how to create a personal access token in GitHub.

Log in to GitHub:
Open your web browser and navigate to GitHub.
Log in with your GitHub username and password.
Access Your Settings:
In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo.
In the drop-down menu, click Settings.
2. Navigate to Developer Settings:

In the left sidebar, click Developer settings.
Generate a New Token:
In the left sidebar, click Personal Access Tokens.
Click the Generate new token button.
Configure the Token:
Token Description: Enter a descriptive name for your token to remember its purpose, such as “Mulesoft Integration”.
Select Scopes: Choose the scopes or permissions you want to grant this token. Common scopes include:
repo: Full control of private repositories
workflow: Update GitHub Action workflows
write:packages: Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry
delete:packages: Delete packages from GitHub Package Registry
admin:repo_hook: Full control of repository hooks
user: Access user profile data
For general use, selecting repo is often sufficient, but you should tailor the permissions to your specific needs to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
Generate and Copy the Token:
Once you’ve selected the necessary scopes, click the Generate token button at the bottom of the page.
GitHub will generate your token and display it. Copy this token immediately as it will not be shown again.

5. Creating a Mulesoft Project for connecting GitHub
1. Create a new project

2. Drag and drop the http listener connector

::: add host as localhost

::: port as 8081(user choice)

::: path BitBucketURL(user choice)

3. If URL encoding is needed use Dataweave transformation to do that.The code which can be used for that is “url”:decodeURI( payload.url), then drag HTTP request connector and config the details like below:
